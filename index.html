        <p>
                    Hi, my name is Osa and I will be going into my senior year in the Fall of 2019. I was born in Cambodia and came to the U.S
                at the age of 6 and practically lived in Rhode Island my whole life. My favorite sports to watch on t.v are football, basketball,
                and occasionally volleyball(mostly during the Olympics). My favorite team is the Patriots and although I do not have a favorite
                basketball team, I mainly cheer for the Golden State Warrriors because I enjoy watching Stephen Curry. I keep myself active by playing 
                volleyball and basketball. Sometimes in the summer I would play sand volleyball on a team. Besides my love for sports, I also enjoy 
                eating and exploring new foods. My favorite food are seafood especially crabs. After I graduate, I hope to own a business one day 
                and also travel to as many countries around the world as possible.
